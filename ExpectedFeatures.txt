Railway Reservation system for Migrant Labourers:
Features expected in the system:
1. Structure-based implementation of trains (train no., source, destination, seats left) and
tickets (PNR, passenger name, train no). The date has been ignored considering the trains
operate for a single day. PNR is an auto-increment value starting from 1.
2. Details of all trains – from Delhi to Major cities – should be stored in a text file to be loaded
and displayed while accessing the system.
3. Ticket data should be stored in a separate text file and available for reading anytime.
4. Menu-driven enquiry, booking, and cancellation facilities.
5. Enquiry menu will ask for source and destination input, and if the source is any station
other than Delhi, show no trains available. Otherwise, display the number of seats left in
the train.
6. Booking menu should ask for passenger name, source and destination. Assume booking
can be done only for 1 person per PNR. Upon booking, the seats left in that train should
be decremented. You should also check whether seats are available before booking the
ticket.
7. Cancellation menu should subtract 50% cancellation charges and then display the refund
amount. Delete that entry from the ticket data file. The cancelled tickets should be freed
up and should be added to the available quota of that particular train.
